# PizzaOnline
A website concept done as a collage project based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Page content is in Finnish.

Bulma was used as a framework.

# Goals
Create a simple, modern looking website concept for a pizza shop. Site includes a login/sign-up system for users and a shopping cart/ordering system.

Personally I wanted to add some special functionality to the page. I achieved this in the Food menu ("MENU") portion of the page using filters to show different food types.
